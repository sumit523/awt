####  :pencil:  Flat-Web Project

:octocat: One-page responsive desktop-first website based on a PSD template. Uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the mobile menu.

You can see the original image of the project [here](http://s11.postimg.org/5p74mbqpf/flat_web.png). Since the template itself already seems a little old and outdated, I decided to see what I could do to renew it a little by changing some of the text and adding a few call-to-action phrases. I also got rid of that pyramid looking thing on the hero section.   
##### With this project, I learned to...   
– Stylize more complex parts from the design to plain CSS, as seen at the benefits section.  
– Add that little 'v' looking detail at the navigation menu, as well as the round blue border.   
– Deal with different styles for items at the footer section, including the column titles and the paypal image.
